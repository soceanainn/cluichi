#.CartaiVsDaonnachta
Cards Against Humanity Clone (Irish Language Version)
Uses Node.js, Express and Socket.io

##.To-Do:
-Add more questions (question sparsity limits the number of players who can play per game)
-Make responsive (support phones better)
-Account for questions that require two answers
-Allow blank cards
-Group all strings in a separate file or section (to make translation into other languages easier)
-Make the design more modular so that it can be used as a template for more games
